    "# <center> Replicate 3 SNV and gene trajectories in Lactobacillus evolution experiment </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we last talked, we discussed plotting allele frequency trajectories for Replicate 3 specifically. As I understood it, Karina's analysis indicated that there may have been a SNV replacement in Replicate 3. Producing these plots was meant to head off possible reviewer critiques. I have produced these plots, as well as additional plots showing the dynamics of gene \"copy number\", a proxy for the frequency of a gene in the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, I chose the hybrid assembly of the ancestral strain (LpWF-Nanopore) as a reference genome against which to align reads. As we only expect to see gene (particularly plasmid) loss during the course of the experiment, the gene content of this ancestral strain should contain the gene contents of all derived strains. The hybrid assembly should contain both core and accessory genome elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I mapped reads to this reference genome with MIDAS, and called SNVs and gene copy numbers in each sample. In MIDAS, the gene \"copy number\" is the mean read coverage of that gene relative to the mean read coverage of 13 single-copy, universal genes. In practice, genes present in all cells in a population will have copy number ~1, while a gene present in only 10% of cells will have copy number 0.1. "

In the first phase (roughly timepoints 0-25), the allele remains near its initial value.

    "* All 3 SNVs exhibit sigmoid dynamics, exactly as expected were they truly under selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that it's entirely possible that these single nucleotide evolutionary dynamics are not independent of the gene loss dynamics (i.e. loss of colonization island). Rather, there may be epistatic effects/feedbacks between these SNVs and the genes. For instance, SNV 1 might in theory render cells non-competent for transformation, hastening the loss of the colonization island by preventing its re-uptake from the environment. Similarly, the evolutionary changes at SNVs 2 and 3 may prevent that mobile element protein from being entirely lost from the population."
